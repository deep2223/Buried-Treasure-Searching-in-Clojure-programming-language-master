# Buried Treasure Searching in Clojure Programming Language

You can assume that you are an intrepid explorer, searching for buried treasure. Specifically, you are underground, wandering through a series of very dark tunnels. You have no light and no signs to guide your way. All you can do is blindly feel around and wander through the tunnels until you hopefully enter the room that contains the treasure. You can, however, leave a trail of breadcrumbs behind you so that if you come to the end of a tunnel and you canâ€™t go any further, you can get back to where you were and try again in another direction.

A map of the tunnels will be stored in a simple text file. The map is used by the application to determine if the explorer can move in a certain direction. The map could look like this:<br>

*- - - # - - # # # - - - -* <br>
*- # - - - # - - - - # # -* <br>
*# # # #- # -# - # - ##* <br>
*- - - # - - - # - # - - -* <br>
*- # - ### # - - - # # -* <br>
*- # - - - - - - # - - - -* <br>
*- # # ## ## ## ## ##* <br>
*- - - - - - - - - - - - @* <br>
